Welcome to the un-official zombies mode for overwatch!

This mega project is meant to span every map in the game, using the same core gameloop but introducing new boss fights, new perks, new small mechanics and abilities per map. 
The vision of the project is to develop something that can be a high production quality gamemode even within the overwatch workshop constraints
its meant to be visually clear, have cutscenes, story, as well as a heavy focus on game balance and challenge to keep you coming back. as well as play with your friends!
the story itself is meant to feel like it could fit into the vision of overwatch, with the twist that ramattra has been taken over by a virus and the new villan. 

to view the current development page please check out this link! https://workshop.codes/t5m30

the current workflow will just be to lay out the heavy foundation for all the maps. so once the current map is at release, bring all the other maps to the bare minimum, placing all the map vectors and assets where they should go.
then come back around to each one along the way, to refine those features and introduce new ones that might be fitting to the theme of the map. 
i will also be bringing the gamemode to the OSTW language, to allow for other programming paradigms.


to find the current development project - go to PvE 2.0 all maps -> == corelogic all maps AND -> antarctic peninsula

To import this gamemode into overwatch first install the overpy extension -> navigate to the map you wish to compile e.g. antarctric P 
-> go to main.opy -> click the {} you will notice in the top right if you installed overpy 
-> open an ovewatch custom game -> import the code for the map to be able to import the map settings e.g. T5M30 
-> delete all the current game rules from the in-game editor -> import the game rules in the rules section that you copied from main.opy with {}
